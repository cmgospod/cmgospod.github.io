My most recent data science project is complete! With my team, I made an app to predict AirBnB prices for the city of Berlin, Germany based on previous data. We used predictive modeling to generate recommended prices, including a confidence interval. You can find the frontend [here](https://hostifyapp.netlify.com/) or the Github repo [here](https://github.com/bw-airbnbprice3).
