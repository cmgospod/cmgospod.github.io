I'm proud to have collaborated on Groa, a new movie recommendation engine. I worked with a team of data scientists and made a working engine in eight weeks. My primary role in the project was data acquisition, building and deploying web scrapers on AWS. I learned a lot about dealing with html in Python and especially about making use of AWS while keeping costs low.

Since my time on the project another team has picked up the project to continue iterating on the model and spruce up the frontend. You can check out the site [here](https://www.groa.us/) or the repository [here](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/Groa-ds).
